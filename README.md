Switcheroo
----------
[Switcheroo](http://www.switcheroo.io/) is for anyone who spends more time using a keyboard than a mouse. Instead of alt-tabbing through a (long) list of open windows, Switcheroo allows you to quickly switch to any window by typing in just a few characters of its title. It's inspired by Emacs's IDO mode buffer switching and JetBrains' ReSharper.
